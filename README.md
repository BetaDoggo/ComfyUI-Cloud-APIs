# ComfyUI-fal-api
I wanted to use some larger models in my local ComfyUI workflows but I'm too gpu poor. Currently the only model supported is Flux (schnell, dev, and pro) but I'll probably add more when I find the time.

# Setup
1. Install the extension with the "Install via Git URL" option in comfyUI manager
2. Create an account at [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/)
3. Go to https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys and click "Add key"
4. Name the key then copy it into a text file in the ComfyUI-fal-api/keys folder. (there is a placeholder nokey.txt file which you can delete)
5. Consult the [models](https://fal.ai/models) page to get an idea of how much each generation will cost
6. Go to https://fal.ai/dashboard/billing and top up your account. For your financial well-being I recommend against automated topups, but I can't stop you.
